      <h1>Mobile Panini</h1>
      <p>
        Mobile Panini is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
        Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the authentic
        recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he learned
        the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his technique at the
        Culinary Institute of Milan.
      </p>
      <p>
        younger brother, Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good
        food, also worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the
        open-air fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud
        graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan. Now you can enjoy what they
        have learned and mastered, right outside your door; but with no
        compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation. We've partnered
        with <b>Curbside Thai</b> to bring you the finest cuisine on four wheels
        - from the East and the West!
